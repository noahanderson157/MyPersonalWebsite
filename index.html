            <div class="aboutMe">
                <p> <span> Introduction: </span> Hello! My name is Noah Anderson, I am a sophomore attending The University of West Florida, I am majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have a passion for problem-solving, logic and mathematics. I want to work in the mathematical sciences or data science. I would enjoy working large data sets: gathering, managing, manipulating and analyzing data. </p>
                <p> <span> My Personals: </span> I am 20 years old. I was born in China and adopted at the age of 5. I have lived in the US since I was adopted. I've called Pensacola my home since then as well. Since I was young, I have had an aptitude for problem-solving and logic puzzles. Throughout my primary and secondary education, I had a keen memory which helped me perform well in school. In high school, I attended Pensacola High Schools' international Baccalaureate, graduating in May 2022. Since then, I have been attending The University of West Florida. Given I had enjoyed math, I pursued a mathematics major; however, I felt I wanted to apply my knowledge gained in math, thus, I chose to pursue a computer science major. Since then, I have been working on various coding and math projects to tune my knowledge in these subjects further. </p>
                <p> <span> Hobbies: </span> Some hobbies I have are, playing chess, running, reading books, listening to music and solving random puzzles that come to my mind. I enjoy playing chess with friends and at times, I go to chess tournaments as well. My favorite genre of books is fantasy books as well as any good sci-fi/dystopian books.</p>
